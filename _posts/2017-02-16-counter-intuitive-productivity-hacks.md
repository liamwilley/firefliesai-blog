I‚Äôm officially obsessed with finding ways to be more productive. By now, I must have tried a hundred productivity tools and read a thousand related articles. To document my learning, I‚Äôve even already written about my favorite ways to improve productivity.
However, I‚Äôve lately come across some interesting, atypical practices that can enhance our methods of staying productive.

6. Listen to turn up music (a.k.a. lit, üî•, savage, dope AF)
Over the last decade, there have been many studies which have concluded that listening to high tempo music can improve focus. Many of these reviews are focused on athletes, such as one from Dr. Costas Karageorghis, one of the world‚Äôs leading expert on the psychology of exercise music:
Music distracts people from pain and fatigue, elevates mood, increases endurance, reduces perceived effort and may even promote metabolic efficiency.

In an interview with Time Magazine, Michael Phelps revealed what music he was listening to during the legendary #PhelpsFace meme. It was ‚ÄúStick Talk‚Äù by Future, a popular hip-hop artist.
Phelps said the music helps him ‚Äútune everything out, and take one step at a time.‚Äù The fast rhythm and strong beat of genres like hip-hop, trap and house help create a performance drive that can keep our minds focused on important work.
I‚Äôm listening to Spotify‚Äôs Get Turnt playlist & the new Culture album by Migos.
5. #DeleteUber and lose touch with the world
If even for a week, stop using Uber. This is unrelated to both President Trump‚Äôs travel ban and the actions of Uber‚Äôs CEO. It turns out that deleting Uber, Lyft and other convenient apps can actually make us more productive.
Looking at my Uber history over the last few months, most of the usage has stemmed from going out to places like brunch and bars. Without the convenience of Uber, it‚Äôs a bigger pain to get around. Instead of going out, more time can be spent doing career-related work.
Furthermore, not having a phone can become a productivity increase. Just leave it at home for a day and see what happens. With so many real-time alerts and notifications that do not actually need to be real-time, our productivity takes a hit. Every distraction embogs our flow of work.

I was recently without a phone for two weeks, and during that time I got four weeks‚Äô worth of work done. I also got lost in San Francisco, but it was worth it.
Taking the concept one step further and disconnecting from Facebook, Gmail and Slack for a few hours is incredibly useful. If we can lock the mind into a mental room that only contains our work and our resolve, we can accomplish much more than expected.
4. Don‚Äôt get distracted, get incredibly distracted
If we cannot keep our focus, we should at least keep the intensity. Whenever I find myself scrolling through Facebook or other social media, I try to viciously consume the distractions until I am sick of them.
The worst is when I catch myself absent-mindedly scrolling with no end in sight. There is an unlimited stream of media; however, the most interesting stuff is ranked at the top of the feed. Being cognizant of this is a good way to get back to work faster.
It is possible to consume other activities at a higher intensity as well. Turn meals into speed eating competitions. Queue up interesting articles, then swiftly skim them all at once. Work out with maximum effort, then take the most refreshing nap ever. Spring awake when the alarm goes off.
Including myself, many subscribe to the philosophy that if something is worth doing, then it‚Äôs worth doing at 100%. This thinking should also apply to unconventional activities like scrolling through news feeds. When we ultimately come back to the tasks at hand, we can then transfer a sense of urgency from the distraction work to the productive work.
3. Lie to yourself and create fake pressure
Some of the most productive work happens when we are hurried. One illustrative indicator of this is the feeling that we sometimes get right before heading to a meeting or other venue.
During the hour leading up to changing locations, I have an unparalleled productive spurt. My mind feels the pressure to work fast, and so there is a natural focus driver that wards away distractions.
This notion of productive work happening during hurried times can be seen in the National Football League. The best drives in the NFL arguably occur in the final five minutes of close games, during which every second matters. The players must feel immense pressure to succeed; even the eyes of fans are glued to their TV screens. That level of focus cannot be commanded from even the most eloquent speakers.

Fan reactions to Super Bowl LI
With these principles in mind, we can trick our brains into working harder, faster and more focused. The secret I adopt is setting frequent arbitrary deadlines which create fake pressure. For example, I sometimes tell myself:
‚ÄúIf we are able to ship these fixes and this feature by Thursday, we‚Äôll promote our product on another marketing channel.‚Äù
Although the deadline is trivial, the pressure that is created encourages us to work towards the goal faster. In the background, this really triggers an Action‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäReward incentive, leading to a greater chance that the mind will stay focused. This methodology is researched by Nir Eyal in Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products.
Beyond just products, it can be applied to productivity habits.
2. Always expect to be the underdog
If there‚Äôs one lesson that the world has learned over the past year, it would be to stop minimizing the underdog. From Brexit to President Trump to the Patriots overcoming a 25-point deficit in 18 minutes, we have seen underdogs succeed over and over.

These surprising events can happen when the expected winner stays complacent or preservative while the other entity is driven to succeed.
In addition to sports and politics, this pattern repeats itself in business and in work. A startup ‚Äúdisrupts‚Äù a market when their offering is able to meet consumer needs much better than the legacy winner. At this point, the legacy winner is likely unable to realize that they are falling behind.
For teams and individuals alike, staying productive can be a matter of consistently feeling like we need to catch up. For this reason, it‚Äôs important to realize that there is always room to improve, and that if we don‚Äôt work hard, somebody else will.
1. Stay blissfully happy
None of the above tactics will work if they drive us to insanity. It‚Äôs critical to stay excited and passionate about what we are doing, as it is a contagious disease that spreads to everyone around us.
At the end of the day, productivity is a factor of the people around us, and theirs of ours. Being positive and happy is one of the best ways to encourage qualities like openness, trust and comfort that are so necessary for good habits to spread.
And, happiness doesn‚Äôt merely feel good‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit leads to success.
In his medium post, Benjamin P. Hardy does a great job of explaining Harvard psychologist Shawn Achor‚Äôs TED Talk. In a nutshell, the talk describes how most people have happiness backwards‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey think that reaching success leads to happiness, but that it is actually the other way around. I encourage readers to explore further.

Staying positive is an incredibly important piece in every facet of my life, and I am lucky to have an upbringing that prioritized positivity. Although work and worldly settings can be bleak, if we can stay happy then we have already won the battle.
